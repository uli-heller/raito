02 - Load Javascript Within Element
===================================

I'd like to have these elements:

- top.md ... contains my logo
- navbar.md ... contains the navbar
- hide.html ... contains a button and javascript to hide "top.md"

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work.
The javascript function within hide.html cannot be
executed. Moving the function into index.html makes
this work ok!

```html
```
